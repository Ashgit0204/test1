Colt Steele is a great instructor. He teaches so many topics so well.
I wish I knew a lot more Mathematics like Terrence Tao, David Hilbert and Cauchy. Trevor Hastie is a brilliant statistician and so is David Efron.Prof. Sellke was a great instructor.
Purdue's campus is so so beautiful. All purple, all green, all gorgeous.
Patti Foster helped a lot during my time at Purdue. She was a great office assistant.
